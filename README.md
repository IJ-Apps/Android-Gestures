# Android-Gestures
This repository provides code for detecting gestures on Views in Android. For example, it has code for responding to long presses, double taps, flings, and more. Simply copy and paste to use it!

**To get the code, simply go to to the [MainActivity.java](https://github.com/IJ-Apps/Gesture-Detection/blob/master/app/src/main/java/app/ij/androidgestures/MainActivity.java) file and copy and paste it as you need.**
